\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to describe the testing, verification and validation procedures that will be used to confirm the correctness of Group 10's \emph{Abstract Art Generator} project. Since the project deals with a graphical user interface, most of the testing involved will be composed of manual tests. The rest of the tests will mainly involve white box testing techniques such as unit testing. Regarding V\&V, the product will be considered verified if it functions smoothly and passes all tests, and it will be considered valid if it satisfies all group members.

\subsection{Scope}

The \emph{Abstract Art Generator} project is a Python program which uses Pygame and Pygame\_GUI to display a graphical user interface that allows interaction with the user. It generates random abstract art images that may be exported as PNG files. The scope of testing will cover the various settings of layer generation such as different shapes, styles, sizes, and complexities of each layer. It will also cover the randomization of layer and color palette settings.

\subsection{Overview of Document}

This document describes the testing methods that will be used to test the first version of this project.

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
This software will allow users to generate abstract art, which can then be exported by the user as a PNG file. This art can be randomly generated, or can be generated based on the user's choices. The software receives these choices using user input, including both keyboard input and mouse input.
\subsection{Test Team}
The test team consists of Aamina Hussain, Jessica Dawson, and Fady Morcos. They are all equally responsible for testing the software.
%\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
\subsection{Testing Tools}
The tool we will be using to test the software is Pylint. This tool will allow us to perform some static tests, help us with debugging, and ensure we are following the correct coding guidelines and style.
\subsection{Testing Schedule}
Please refer to the Gantt Chart at
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/3xa3-l3-g10/3xa3-l3-g10/-/tree/main/ProjectSchedule}{this link}.

\section{Unit Testing Plan}

\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
N/A\\
\color{red}\#\#COMMENT: Due to the nature of the program, its randomization, and its output being a randomized image, we decided to not perform automated testing. Unit tests are not extensive enough to thoroughly test the changes made to the UI display as a result of some user input. All of the functionality of the program can be tested using manual testing, which is what we will use.\color{black}
% We will be conducting unit tests on certain internal functions that have return values. We will give the program methods different inputs, and test whether the actual output is equal to the expected output using PyTest.
